- **Azure SQL Database**: Used to store structured data like housing affordability data.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Used for storing unstructured data, such as large CSV files.

### How to Access Data in Azure
The data stored in Azure can be accessed using Azure SDKs or by connecting to the Azure SQL Database from within the project code using secure credentials.
